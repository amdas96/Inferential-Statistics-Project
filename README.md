Business Report Problem Statements

1)Injury Analysis of a Male Football Team:
The dataset provided details the number of injured players categorized by their positions within the football team. Using this data, we need to address probability-related questions, such as:
  a)What is the probability that a randomly selected player is injured?
  b)What is the probability that a randomly selected player, who plays in the striker position, has sustained a foot injury?

2)Breaking Strength of Gunny Bags:
  We are given the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the breaking strength of gunny bags used for cement packaging. The task involves calculating specific proportions based on the normal distribution and providing visual representations, such as normal distribution curves with shaded areas, to effectively illustrate these proportions. The specific questions include:
    a)The proportion of gunny bags with a breaking strength less than 3.17 kg/sq cm.
    b)The proportion of gunny bags with a breaking strength of at least 3.6 kg/sq cm.
    c)The proportion of gunny bags with a breaking strength between 5 kg and 5.5 kg per sq cm.
    d)The proportion of gunny bags with a breaking strength not within the range of 3 kg to 7.5 kg per sq cm.

3)Hypothesis Testing for Zingaro Stone Printing:
  Zingaro Stone Printing specializes in printing patterns on both polished and unpolished stones. We need to conduct hypothesis testing to assess:
    a)Whether unpolished stones are suitable for printing compared to polished stones.
    b)Whether there is a significant difference in the mean hardness between polished and unpolished stones.

4)Analysis of Dental Implant Hardness:
  The hardness of metal implants used in dental procedures is influenced by multiple factors, including the implant method, treatment temperature, alloy composition, and the preferences of individual dentists. The following analyses are required:
    a)Variation by Dentist: How does the hardness of implants vary according to different dentists?
    b)Variation by Method: How does the hardness of implants vary based on the method used?
    c)Interaction Effect: What is the interaction effect between dentist and method on the hardness of dental implants for each type of alloy?
    d)Combined Analysis: How does the hardness of implants vary considering the combined effect of both dentists and methods?
